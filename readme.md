# OpenIn

A browser extension that makes it easy for you to open source files you are viewing in the browser from an online service (eg https://dev.azure.com/, https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/, or https://source.chromium.org/chromium) and open the corresponding local file.
In those pages where there is a button to copy the path of the source file, OpenIn will add a button to open the file locally.
You can use settings UI to map URIs to local folder and CSS query that finds the copy the path button.
It works in Edge and Chrome.
